# AI Ultimate Tic Tac Toe V2
This is a university project turned to a mini-passion project in JavaScript on Intelligent Systems (AI) for the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game.
It uses the P5.js library for the graphics.

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, as the name suggests, is an advanced version of the well-known game, Tic Tac Toe.
Similarily, the goal is to win 3 mini- or sub-boards in a line, and to win a sub-board you must form a line in it. Additionally, here's where it becomes challenging:
the previous move deterministically influences/limits the options of the next move. That is, each square maps to a sub-board. Thus, long-term planning and strategy are key! 

The AI itself is Minimax with Alpha-Beta (α–β) pruning to signficantly speed up the process of travesing the game tree and move options.

## Running the Project
  1. Download the project: 
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/MohamedElBakry/AI-UTTT-V2.git
 ```
  2. In the root directory of the project, serve/run it to localhost e.g.: 
  ```shell
  cd AI-UTTT-V2
  python -m http.server -d "dist"
  ```
  3. Open localhost in a browser and navigate to the src directory. If you used python the command above then follow this link: [localhost](http://localhost:8000).

Finally, while playing you may press `F12` then select the `Console` tab to see the AI's evaluation of the current positon in real time.

 ## Example Game
 The following image illustrates a game where the AI, as `X`, won.

## Improvements

1. Code refactoring to streamline the addition and integreation of future features.
2. Offline mode/PWA for on-the-go playing.
3. UI Clarifications e.g.:
    * Sub-board victory/draw. Cover the sub-board with the enlarged symbol of the winning player. 'Grey-out' a drawn sub-board.
    * Game victory/draw.
    * Potential move highlight with right-click.
    * Toggleable evaluation bar on the side.
4. Rules section 
5. Aggregate data and track win-rate iterations versus the AI to determine how tweaks affect its relative strength.

*Feel free to provide suggestions.* :)
